mousemove start
mousemove end

user mouses down and adds :active (at this point it is too late to turn off polling)
poll updates lastscreen
click is seen and sent

click is recoded with the wrong expected state


mousemove end, may need to wait to show tootip (implies polling must continue)
mousemove click (really on mousedown) must not been used for polling image update. 


record mousemove start, use lastscreenshot to set pre-requisite screenshot. 
mouse move end, replace first. don't poll.

in recorder: detect a wait operation (No action in 1 second after the last sent)
record a wait operation
    take a screenshot now.
    prerequisite start state *is* the lastscreenshot (which shows the tooltip)
    no action.
    (this can be collapsed into the NEXT recorded action. always: if previous was a wait, replace it with this one (wait on wait fine too)
