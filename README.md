# brimstone-recorder

Brimstone is a web application test recorder, test player and pixel perfect test validator all in one.

1. Fire up the brimstone recorder workspace for the current tab.
2. Record some actions.
3. Save them.
4. Play them back anytime, and see if the app still works exactly like it did when the test was recorded.

A strict do no harm tester, it requires every pixel to be accounted for.
