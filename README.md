# What?

Brimstone is a web application test recorder, test player and pixel perfect test validator all in one.

1. Fire up the brimstone recorder workspace for the current tab.
2. Record some actions.
3. Save them.
4. Play them back anytime, and see if the app still works and looks *exactly* like it did when the test was recorded.

Brimstone is a strict do no harm tester: it requires every pixel to be accounted for.

# Recording

Go to some website. Poke the (B) icon to start recording on this tab.  

## Tips

* Type slowly. Brimstone is doing stuff for each key you press, and if you do too many too fast, some events may be missed. 
* Always end your recording by pressing the 'End Recording' button.
* Save your recordings.
* Menus that pop up on hover can be recorded by holding down the Ctrl key, moving to the location that pops up the menu, then releasing the Ctrl key.

## Limitations
As new features are added this list should hopefully get smaller.
 
* Only user actions in the page itself are recorded. e.g. The browser back and forward buttons are not recorded.
* Only click, double-click, right-click, and single-keypresses are recorded. e.g. Chords like Ctrl-A are not recorded.
* Only tab one is recorded, although that tab is free to navigate to different URLs and still be recorded. e.g. Web application spawned browser windows/tabs are not included in the current recording.
